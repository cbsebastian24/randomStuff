The goal of this project is to demonstrate your ability to apply the concepts you have learned in this course to a real-world data set. You will be graded on the quality of your analysis, the clarity of your code, and the effectiveness of your communication.\n",

For the written portions of the project, use of GenAI should be cited in a way that make clear how the GenAI tool was used. The *GenAI Appendix* section at the end provides a template you can use to indicate how you used tools like ChatGPT for each section.

This research project is the longest continuous study of any predator-prey system in the world. ([Source](https://isleroyalewolf.org/overview/overview/at_a_glance.html))\n",

Use the model to predict some interesting cases. Use either a training-test set split or cross validation to assess the accuracy of the classifier. If the classifier has tuning parameters, try several values of the tuning parameters to see how they affect the accuracy of the classifier."
